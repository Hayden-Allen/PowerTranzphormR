## **Welcome to the future of 3-dimensional modeling and design!**

**_PowerTranzphormR®_**  gives developers the power to create video game worlds like those in today's next-generation games:  *Super Mario 64*,  *GoldenEye: 007*,  *Quake*, and many others.

Pushing the boundaries of virtual reality experiences has never been so easy (and fun!)!

Learn how to em*Power*  your digital content creation pipeline below.

## Cool features!

### Real-Time Constructive Solid Geometry

https://personal.utdallas.edu/~hsa190003/assets/csg.m4v

Create complex <span style="color:red">**Phormz®**</span> from simple Boolean operations and geometric primitives. Are primitives a little too, err... primitive, for you? Then you'll be relieved to know that our CSG pipeline seamlessly supports manually deformed meshes, for ultimate artist control!

### State-of-the-Art Lighting Effects

https://personal.utdallas.edu/~hsa190003/assets/light.m4v

Let there be <span style="color:yellow">**light**</span>! Illuminate your scenes with Area, Point, Spot, and Directional Lights. Separate controls for ambient, diffuse, and specular parameters, along with additional type-specific controls, enable artists to define a unique aesthetic for every level.

### Integrated Procedural Texture Generation

https://personal.utdallas.edu/~hsa190003/assets/texture.m4v

Transfer your imagination to the screen! Our **PowerTextuRe®** pipeline generates <span style="color:cyan">**cool**</span> textures from simple text prompts. Disappointed by the lacklustre offerings of popular CD-ROM texture catalogs? In one click, **PowerTextuRe®** provides the perfect tiling texture automatically converted to a game-ready resolution. *(Requires  [AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)).*

### Fine-Grained Geometry Manipulation

https://personal.utdallas.edu/~hsa190003/assets/vertex.m4v

Sometimes, even CSG and advanced lighting techniques aren't enough. That's why **_PowerTranzphormR®_** provides direct vertex manipulation capabilities to satisfy even the most demanding artist. Make your designs pop with <span style="color:lime">**per-vertex colors**</span>, texture blending, and UV animation.
